# 👋 Hi, I’m Killian MARY 
also known as El Gordo Guapo or @yramnaillik on social medias ! 🤳

I'm currently both working at mipih in Toulouse, France as software engineer and studying in the IT engineer school called ISIS in Castres, France. I also work in a student enterprise called Horus HealthCare Systems in which I'm IT Manager.

I'm interested in almost everything around IT and Health, particularly in human health. This is exactly what we learn at ISIS and what I do at MiPih.
I'm also interested in the way to mix IT and sport, specially rugby my favourite sport over all. :football:
